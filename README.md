Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working on implementing AI into a financial stock picking application as that interests me.
- I'm currently learning about the basics of javascript and taking a deeper dive into python and AI
- I'm looking to collaborate on projects relating to the real world implementation of AI
- I'm looking to help with any small or big project (I don't discriminate) that will help me gain experience with coding and or AI
- Fun fact about me: I play the saxophone
